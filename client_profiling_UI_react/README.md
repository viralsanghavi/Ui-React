One page React app that takes in user input, makes a query to a Neo4j database, and displays the results of the query as a graph.

Queries are hard coded Cypher queries (hard coded in that they take in user input, but are hard coded to the specific schema of a fabricated dataset we have been using).

Graph visualization done using Neovis.js.
